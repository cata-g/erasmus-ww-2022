                        <p class="d-flex justify-content-start text-start">Thomas Alva Edison, born in Ohio on February 11, 1847, was one of the most well-known inventors of all time. He spent a few of his
						early years in formal schooling, but he received most of his education at home. 
                        Thomas set up a laboratory in the basement of his family's Michigan home and spent most of his time experimenting.Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections.
                         He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness.
                          As he was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping 
                          his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work.

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-end text-end">Thomas Edison began his career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit.
                         He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments.After the failure of his first invention, the electric vote recorder, Edison moved to New York City.
                          There he improved the way the stock ticker worked. This was his big break. By 1870 his company was manufacturing his stock ticker in Newark, New Jersey.
                          He also improved the telegraph, making it send up to four messages at once.</p>

                    <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center" style="color:#ff8533;">The first patent of a light bulb</h4>
                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-end text-center">Edison's lamp would consist of a filament housed in a glass vacuum bulb. He had his own glass blowing shed where the fragile bulbs were carefully crafted for his experiments.
                         Edison was trying to come up with a high resistance system that would require far less electrical power than was used for the arc lamps. 
                        This could eventually mean small electric lights suitable for home use.By January 1879, at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had built his first high resistance, incandescent electric light. It worked by passing electricity through a thin platinum filament in the glass vacuum bulb, which delayed the filament from melting.
                         Still, the lamp only burned for a few short hours. In order to improve the bulb, Edison needed all the persistence he had learned years before in his basement laboratory. He tested thousands and thousands of other materials to use for the filament. 
                        He even thought about using tungsten, which is the metal used for light bulb filaments now, but he couldn't work with it given the tools available at that time.Long before Thomas Edison patented and began commercializing his incandescent light bulb, British inventors were demonstrating that electric light was possible with the arc lamp.These early bulbs had extremely short lifespans, were too expensive to produce or used too much energy.</p>
