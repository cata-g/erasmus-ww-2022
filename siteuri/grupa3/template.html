						Mesopotamian civilization is credited with the invention of the wheel. 
						However, unlike other breakthrough inventions, the wheel cannot be attributed to a single nor several inventors. 
						Evidence of early usage of wheeled carts have been found across the Middle East, in Europe, Eastern Europe, and China. 
						It is not known whether Chinese and Europeans invented the wheel independently or not.

					They made covered wagons as well as four wheeled carts . 
					With covered wagons, the food or people that were in it, could be safe because there was a small risk of falling over. 
					It helped them because they could trade faster and also move from one place to another.</p>

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-end text-center" > Precursors of wheels, known as "tournettes" or "slow wheels", were known in the Middle East by the 5th millennium BCE. 
					One of the earliest examples was discovered at Tepe Pardis, Iran, and dated to 5200–4700 BCE. 
					These were made of stone or clay and secured to the ground with a peg in the center, but required significant effort to turn. 
					True potter's wheels, which are freely-spinning and have a wheel and axle mechanism, were developed in Mesopotamia (Iraq) by 4200–4000 BCE.
					Early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle. Some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks. 
					Because of the uneven structure of wood, a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards.

                    <p class="d-flex justify-content-end text-center"> The wheel was barely used, with the exception of Ethiopia and Somalia, in Sub-Saharan Africa well into the 19th century, but this changed with the arrival of the Europeans.
											The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented.
											Pneumatic tires can greatly reduce rolling resistance and improve comfort. Wire spokes are under tension, not compression, making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light.
