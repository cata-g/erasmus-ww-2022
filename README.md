<h1>Erasmus x 3Multi</h1>

<p>This is a web design project that took place during an Erasmus x 3Multi international project. The goal of the project was to teach international people about web design using Bootstrap. A template was created and used by the participants to build their own website, and all of the final projects were posted on this website. The website also includes a carousel gallery with photos from the project and a short video of the participants reciting a traditional poem "Luceafarul" by Mihai Eminescu.</p>
